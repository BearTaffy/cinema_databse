use a one-way hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or scrypt, to hash the password before storing it in the database

encrypting isnt that important

or have it hashed in the database (it sounds better)

connect to mysql server

set up example data to test

somehow get all movies in the database

maybe get the movies from a api

get images from api using https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics

figure out how to store the needed data in the database

make a file for every insert needed

make a employee page where you can add movies and rooms and other stuff

make a script that will auto make the seats for a room (60 L , 60 R) for the number of rooms in the database

there are 5? rooms with different movies playing at different times and the movies rotate every (some timeframe) and maybe the rooms are different sizes (seat count)

or chould just have one room and one movie in and in sertan timeframes other movies (Would make it easier)

find a way to assign a seatID to each html element
