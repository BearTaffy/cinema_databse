use a one-way hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or scrypt, to hash the password before storing it in the database

encrypting isnt that important

or have it hashed in the database (it sound better)

connect to mysql server

set up example data to test

somehow get all movies in the databse

maybe get the movies from a api
